// Rules: 
// The ¬ symbol is typed with alt+0172 and stands for the logical NOT.
// The V is a capital v, so please do not use the V as a symbol for other purposes. We use it as a logical disjunction.
// Each CLAUSE is divided via ( ), the comma is not a necessity but it makes reading the input easier.
// IMPORTANT :: Each clause has to start with "(" and end with ")" so as to be recognized by our reading method.
// Anything written that starts with // is not considered input.
